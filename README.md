## Objective
![alt text](./pictures/project-description-01.PNG)

Note: for src files, path changes are required

Files are omitted the following intermediate steps:

- extract foreground objects or segment humans using Resnet

- video/image inpainting foreground object, results in a set of pure background images

- stitching foreground and background frame images into panorama simultaneously

## Output 1

## Output 2
![alt text](./pictures/project-output-02.PNG)

## Output 3

- it's trivial and from input images of output 2, since we use image inpainting techniques to produce output 2
